### 💻 What I learned 

I learned so much through this project. I got to experience what it’s like to work with the React framework and manage multiple files. It really makes things easier especially when it comes to keeping the code clean. I spent a lot of time on CSS and I’m pretty happy how it turned out. 

* UseState : Managing form input
* UseEffect:  Loading data when page loads
