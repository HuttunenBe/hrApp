## 💻 What I learned 

I learned so much through this project. I got to experience what it’s like to work with the React framework and manage multiple files. It really makes things easier especially when it comes to keeping the code clean. I spent a lot of time on CSS and I’m pretty happy how it turned out. 

* UseState : Adding state to components
* UseEffect: Running side effects like fetching employee data when the app loads
* UseNavigate:  Navigating after adding an employee
* Routes, BrowserRouter: Switching between pages
* Conditional rendering: Show or hide components like mobile menu
* Date and time calculator: Calculating years of service from start date
* Date.now():  Generating unique IDs
* Props:  Pass data to components
* Event handling: Handling input changes and form submission
